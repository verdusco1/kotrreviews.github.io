    <div class="article">
        <p>Hello hello, and welcome to The Indie Train, where we review games made by independent developers who seek to carry us on a wild and fun and journey with their own skills. I, Seba, would be your conductor for the evening and today we are reviewing an interestingly surprising game called Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadville. A long time ago, I had played the beta and it didn’t necessarily left an impact on me. However, to my surprise, my revisit to the game, now out of beta, was pleasant and fun! Let us dive in a brief but through look into the game of Rebuild 3.</p>
        <p>Rebuild 3 is a bit of an odd game to categorize but I like to think of it as an odd mix of a city resource management game and a survival game. In Rebuild 3, you play as・well whoever you want to be, as the game lets you created your own leader type character that makes all the big choices. Although the character creation leaves a lot to be desired as it mostly just premade sets of faces, clothes, body types, and such. Still it simple enough and you make a decent variety of player characters. I made myself, because I am a vain man who enjoys putting himself in games. One thing to note is that whatever job you pick for yourself will grant you small bonuses and starting items. For example, I use to play as a College Student who bonus perks grants a 25% boost to the effects of engineering houses, schools, and bars. They are granted the bonus item of a calculator, which of course also grants a small bonus. As of recent playthrough I got through I play now as a shop clerk, who perks gives bonuses to scavenging and 25% better trading prices. The starting item is a crowbar, so you can Gordan Freeman your way through your problems (actually it gives bonus defense and scavenging but of course our imagination can run wild here). After making characters you are plonk into a city with a small handful of survivors and given the task of surviving, of course. There is both a story mode and a quick play mode. Story mode has some premade cities that you can rename and you are given a set of tasks to complete until you reach the end goal and win of several multiple endings depending on your choices and whose gang you chosen to help out throughout the game. In quick play you just plonked into a random generated city and just given the task to survive. Of course you got your difficulty settings and in quick play you can chose the size of the city and number of factions. Either you play story or quick play, the gameplay remains the same.</p>
        <p>If you played games like say Sim city or Farmville, you might have some knowledge in playing Rebuild 3, but instead of managing buildings or animals, you manage people and what they do in the buildings. Each survivor has a set job skill of sorts, ranging from Soldiers who act as your main muscle, Builders who of course build and refurbish buildings, Scavengers who obviously great at scavenging but also farming, Engineers who can build tools at workshops or labs, and Leaders who use charm to interact with traders and certain events. Each charter has a happiness lever that affects their behavior, and you can change their equipment to suit and enhance their skills. Of special note is your player character, which has all the skills and immune to death by zombie, in story explanation is that you got bit by a zombie. You can click and drag each survivor to buildings to do a large variety of tasks, depending on the location and type of building. For example, you can build bars to increase happiness, and you can fish at parks for food. You can also stack up characters in a building to order to boost the change of success. You are given the option of changing game speed. I HIGHLY recommend on using the pause time selections, which makes the whole game a turn base game and just feels the fastest in the bunch. You must keep track of several vital stats in the game: Happiness, Food, and your inventory of fuel, bullets, and medication. Running dry will have it consequences as running low of any of those stats will effect gameplay. In my first paly through, I didn’t pay attention to my food supply, and everyone starved to death. My mistake being that I had recruited too many survivors and they were eating fasters than I can produce. It was not pleasant. During the game your game randomly asks to set up policies for your gang of survivors to follow, each as bullet consumption and food rationing. Each choice influences how your survivors behave and each has it benefits and consequences. You are able to change these polices later if the current playstyle ill fits your current needs or find unbeneficial. You can expand your fort by reclaiming buildings and driving out zombies. You can rebuild them into new buildings that each gives benefits and rewards. Farm gives food, apartment lets you expand the amount of survivors, workshop lets Engineers build tools, schools train skills and so on.  You can also encounter many random events that either have permanent or temporary effects. They can be pretty random or they can be at set locations set with an indicator of sorts. You can find new survivors to join your gang and interact with other gangs to trade items and food. One gang of sorts you will frequently counter is a shop keeper of sorts who you can trade resources with, led by the trader Gustav. They tend to roam around while you have to find the fort of other gangs. One gang of special note of is a gang of somewhat sentient Zombies called the Rotten. You don’t see self-aware zombies too often in games, especially in games where they are the main antagonist. It’s a welcome sight to my eyes.</p>
        <p>Speaking of zombies, they are many and they are nasty. They occupy the surrounding landscape and you will have to send survivors to clear them out (soldiers being the best at this of course). They will often form big mobs that show up on the map that can overtake your buildings. Having characters on guard on a building adjacent to the mob can lead to a successful defense. Sometimes the defense fails and you force to make a saving throw of sorts in a set of hard choices that will punish you for failing to defend. You can also preemptively attack the mob but this a risky task itself. You can also haul the survivors out of the buildings and leave it empty for the zombies. This does run the risk of having the zombies reclaiming the building and thus you have to clear them out again. This game is not kind, and it will give you a hard time. In fact, I recommending starting on Easy mode first for first timers in this game as Normal difficulty can be pretty brutal. The choices you make will affect the eventual fate of your gang. Will you be zombie food or will you grow a new empire for human kind? SPEAKING OF DECIDSIONS, LETS GET TO THE RATINGS FOLKS!</p>
        <p><b>GAMEPLAY</b></p>
        <p>Learning the mechanics of the game was surprisingly easy but it does get rather difficult. It gives you many choices and options to suit your style of play and I like it. The balance of risk of reward is a major theme here and it helps to keep attention to your resources. However, progress is rather slow, even at the start. Having the option does help alleviate this problem but even then it does take much time to get things done.</p>
        <p><b>ART AND SOUND</b></p>
        <p>The art style is a nice cartoonish minimalistic style that. It’s a rather colorful game set in the apocalypse. However it does sometimes clash then the game tries to be portray serious events and all you see is your goofy face.  The music is alright but pretty random, but an improvement over the beta, which was rather repetitive. The sounds are decent but lackluster as it mostly stole sound events to add flavor to your actions</p>
        <p><b>SETTING AND PLOT</b></p>
        <p>While the game does have a rather quirky sense of humor time to time, it still has your standard gritty apocalypse atmosphere. While the factions are nice and varied, the characters are usually one note stereotypes but they still amusing in some ways. I think the gameplay was a bigger focus here but I not going to fault the setting entirely. Still the odd humor and the grimdark events do clash here and there</p>
        <p><b>OVERALL RATING</b></p>
        <p><b>I give Rebuild 3 the overall rating of… AN OKAY GAME</b> or for those who prefer numbers a <b>3.5 outa 5</b>. It a great time waster and if you want a game to widdle away</p>
